    <ul>
      <li>
        A: (a) divergent; (b)This is ineffective as there are too many colors in
        the scale, making it confusing to discern data values. For example, blue
        blended with the red makes purple. Furthermore, the scale appears
        perceptually uniform, but isn't aesthetically appealing.
      </li>
      <li>
        B: It's effective since the middle always remains the same color, so it
        is consistently perceived as the center from which the other two colors
        diverge from. This is a divergent scale, which is great for instances
        where there is a middle (neutral in this case).

            Protanomaly: Although, there is a small difference in this case.
            They'll see greyish-blue to lime green.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protanopia: They'll still see a scale, but from grey to yellow.

      <li>
        They shouldn't use a rainbow scale since it's visually jarring, makes it
        difficult to discern an order in the data, and could appear ugly when
        perceptually uniform.
