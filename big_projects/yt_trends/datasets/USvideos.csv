Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press."

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix.

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it.

So sorry! I️t will be back up and running soon! \n\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. It’s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesn’t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, it’s just that it’s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes I’m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. I’d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\n\nMusic Used: \nAvocado Street\nGymnopedie No1\nReflection Pool\nLife in Romance\nSimple Story"

The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”).  Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in “Sully” and in “Dunkirk,” serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, “The 15:17 to Paris.”  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.

In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour – aka Chief Jim Hopper – revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably won’t hit Netflix until 2019! It’s not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text “When you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.” Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLet’s learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. It’s becoming so cruel! Anyway, share your thoughts below on what your predictions for season 3 are and your favorite show you’re currently waiting on.

While implications for the merger remain foggy, one thing most fans want to see is the Fantastic Four and the X-Men return to the MCU – and especially – if it’s enough to lure Hugh Jackman out of retirement. \n\nVariety reports that MGM and Warner Bros. have hired up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson in Creed 2. It was previously reported that Stallone had considered directing sequel at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, made the decision to find another director and after a lengthy search, both Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nDeadline reports that Seth Rogen has signed on to play legendary CBS newsman Walter Cronkite in the upcoming drama Newsflash, directed by his Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green. The drama takes place on November 22, 1963, the day of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, unfolding in real time as Cronkite and his producer Don Hewitt attempt to report on one of the biggest news stories in history. \n\nA new international trailer from Japan has landed online for Black Panther and it features even more unseen footage of the advanced weaponry utilized by the people of Wakanda. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa, who must stand against a powerful old enemy who reappears after years hidden in order to defend the throne and save his people. Black Panther is the next entry in the MCU and opens in theaters on February 16, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jared: https://twitter.com/haibon_jared\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Here's how it works.\n\nSome people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.\n\n**\n\nIf you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...\n\n**\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.\n\nWhy's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.\n\nWhat stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.\n\nWhat did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!\n\n**\n\nCamera: Melanie Cowan\n\nThank you to everyone at ESA and Novespace who helped make this happen!\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

The four programs – which include Start With Hello, Say Something, Signs of Suicide and Safety Assessment & Intervention - are offered free to schools and youth organizations across the country.

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.\n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles.\n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly.  Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment.  Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer."

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da!

The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.\n\nToday, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better we’ve gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating. \n\nOver the years, we’ve come to establish a bit of a love-hate relationship with failure. We still don’t like it, yet we’ve also come to recognize that if we’re not dropping our cards enough, we’re also not going to get any better at Cardistry. And in that sense, we’ve come to find failure rather beautiful. \n\nRISE was birthed from a vision of ours to capture this intriguing beauty of failure.\n\nEnvisioning a juxtaposition between clean forms and abstract swirls, we pictured cards being manipulated with impeccable technique - abruptly interrupted and exploding out of the very hands that shuffled them. \n\nWe imagined them rising from the ground; the cards fluttering through the air in slow motion, dancing like the leaves in the Fall... and returning to our hands - perhaps forming imperfectly at first, then progressing with each step taken, and finally, displayed in all their glory. \n\nYet our stubbornness as Cardists doubling as filmmakers resulted in a few interesting restrictions that we imposed upon ourselves: \n\nIf this “Fall” vision were to be captured, it would have to be done with no CG. Everything had to be filmed in-camera and performed by ourselves with with a real deck of cards.\n\nNext, there would be no use of green screen, compositing, or other camera trickery. The furthest we agreed upon was the reversal of several scenes - and only if they genuinely added to the story we wanted to tell. \n\nAnd finally, the cards used could not be gimmicked in anyway - no strings, magnets or anything of the sort. If what we envisioned could not be accomplished by our technique, then the idea was scrapped. \n\nThankfully, after months of planning, testing, and of course...failing, we finally had the opportunity to transform our vision into a reality. \n\nThrough the use of a Phantom high-speed camera mounted on a Bolt Cinebot (thank you Shooting Gallery Asia), and the help of a leaf blower or two... Rise was born. \n\nWe truly hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it for you. \n\n- The Virts\n\n---\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck\nCredits:\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nCardistry Credits:\nCardistry performed by Virtuoso (The Virts):\nHuron Low \nKevin Ho \nDaren Yeow\n\nCardistry and Card flourish move list (in order shown):\n \nIndice Fans (classic)\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nStairmaster by Kevin Ho (credit to Birger Karlsson and Kenneth Aidan Foo)\nNinja Spring Grab + Replacement by Virtuoso\nFlicker by Huron Low  + Rev 2 Twirl by Daren Yeow\nFlicker Shot Behind the Back by Huron Low\nV Cascade by Daren Yeow\nAerial Combo Sequence by Huron Low (Kick Cut Flip, V Flip, by Huron Low, Railslide Flip, Aerial Cut by Dan and Dave Buck)\nBuzzsaw by Brendan Conner\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nMind Eraser by Kevin Ho (credit to Chris Kenner and Huron Low)\nSatellite by Kevin Ho\nTornado Deck Split by Kevin Ho (credit to Bone Ho)\nPiano Cuts by Andrew Avila\nYo! variation by Daren Yeow (credit to Lee Asher)\nWaterwheel by Huron Low, Daren Yeow, and Elijah Cai\nIndice Fans (classic)\n\nVideo credits:\nDirector: Huron Low of Virtuoso\nDirector of Photography: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nVideo Editor: Daren Yeow of Virtuoso\nLighting by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nColor Grading by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nCrew: The Shooting Gallery Asia\nWardrobe Styling by: Shu Juang\n\nMusic Credits:\nMusic: Rise by Virtuoso \nMusic composed and produced by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio Post and Sound Design by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio samples from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins \n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nThe Shooting Gallery Asia: Seb Tan and his amazing team (shout out to Ahmad Rafa'ie!) for making this #Cardistry shoot possible. \nhttps://www.shootinggalleryasia.com/\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck by #thevirts\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nThe new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/"

Ha arrancado con Yerry Mina descalzándose los zapatos y las medias en un ritual habitual en él antes de pisar el césped y llevar a cabo los habituales toques de balón. Era la primera vez que el central lucía la que será su nueva equipación a partir de ahora, y ha dejado clara su felicidad con un grito apasionado: ¡Vamos, Barça! Visca, Barça!.\n\nA continuación, el jugador ha posado para los medios de comunicación -se han acreditado 103 periodistas, 25 de ellos colombianos, de un total de 70 medios diferentes- y ha completado un rondo con jóvenes jugadores de la cantera. Después el futbolista ha recibido su coche AUDI.\n\nCon cualquier otro jugador la presentación habría acabado segundos más tarde. Pero Yerry Mina se ha acercado hasta el gol para saludar a toda la afición que lo ha venido a recibir. Y allí ha dejado una pequeña pincelada de uno de sus rasgos más característicos: el baile de salsa 'choke' que suele llevar a cabo cada vez que marca un gol. Seguro que volveremos a ver este movimiento en un futuro."

I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you."

This film follows one such researcher, whose passion leads her to initiate a new technique inspired by a black bear program in rural New Hampshire.  What starts as a cross-culture collaboration becomes a life-changing journey for an American biologist who crosses an ocean to join her; a scientist from Inner Mongolia; and a very curious female cub named Qian Qian, born in captivity. \n\nCaptured with IMAX® Cameras, join Qian Qian on an exciting new adventure in the mountains of Sichuan as she takes her first steps outside her protected habitat, discovering her true animal nature…even as she faces the challenges of the unknown. \n\nDavid Douglas and Drew Fellman, the filmmakers behind “Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar,” directed the film, which Fellman wrote and produced, with Douglas as director of photography.  Donald Kushner and Steve Ransohoff also produced the film, with Li Gen Xiong and Elie Samaha executive producing and Neal Allen serving as line producer. \n\n“Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar” editor Beth Spiegel and composer Mark Mothersbaugh collaborated with Douglas and Fellman once again, with sound design by Gus Koven. \n\nIMAX Entertainment presents, in association with IMAX Documentary Films Capital and Panda Productions, “Pandas.”   The film will be released in select IMAX® and IMAX® 3D theaters starting April 6, 2018.

If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/"

A wealth of problems. Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for Trust, FX’s new series from Academy Award winners Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Premieres March 25th.\n\nSubscribe now for more Trust clips: http://bit.ly/SubscribeFX \n\nTrust delves into the trials and triumphs of one of America’s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn’t pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul’s grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He’s busy. Paul’s father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul’s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she’s broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson’s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle. The show is produced by FX Productions, Cloud Eight Films, Decibel Films and Snicket Films Limited.\n\nTrust | Season 1: Official Trailer [HD] | FX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/FXNetworks"

This is why.\nWant to see Tonya' Harding's routine? You can find one version here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdC5G7CDvbI\n\nNote: The video states Mirai Nagasu was the second American to land a triple axel in competition (this was recorded before her Olympic success). In 2005, American Kimmy Miessner completed a triple axel in national competition, though not world competition. You can read about it here: http://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=1967992\n\nFollow Vox's full 2018 Winter Olympics coverage here: http://bit.ly/2nVUSz2\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the triple axel and why it's such a big deal. The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.\n\nAs a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.\n\nAnd that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

They are also armed with a gland at the rear of their heads which, when threatened, can spray a corrosive, strong-smelling substance. Because their natural habitat is so small, their survival is precarious—thankfully, captive breeding efforts may bring these insects back from the brink.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Planet Earth series.

We went for a full on Mexican street food tour in Puebla, Mexico, and discovered the most incredible FAST cutting sandwich lady, with the fastest knife cutting skills, kind of like the Super Human Sandwich Fruit Ninja of Mexico, along with amazing tacos with spicy salsa and delicious mole poblano! ALL of the Best Mexican Street Food!\n\nIn this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious. \n\nThe Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious\n\nWe started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44\nhttps://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek\n\nAfter this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. \n\nAfter eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can .

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.\n\nThe film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).\n\nMcCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.\n\nFalcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films). The music is by Fil Eisler (“How to Be Single,” “Empire”).\n\nNew Line Cinema Presents, an On the Day Production, “Life of the Party.” Slated for release on May 11, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company. It has been rated PG-13."

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer."

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\n－Sukiyaki Sauce－\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\n－Vegetables－\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25°C/77°F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15°C/59°F 20 hours\nWinter: 5°C/41°F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75°C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

In defining ‘worst’- we’ve looked for one, or a combination, of the following: design flaws, conceptual mistakes, being extremely dangerous, being unpleasant to fly, or obsolete at the point of service entry (and the type must have entered service).

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separated from the center core and returned to landing site for future reuse.  \n\nFalcon Heavy put a Tesla Roadster and its passenger, Starman, into orbit around the sun. At max velocity Starman and the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth."

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl’s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it’s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award® nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who—a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer—plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch’s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos’ holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018."

Ek3aeUhHaFY,18.14.03,"Primitive Technology: Lime","Primitive Technology",22,2018-03-06T22:00:03.000Z,[none],3961163,129868,1782,10684,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/default.jpg,False,False,False,"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

This is a historic win as Peele is the first black writer to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn Get Out, photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is nervous about meeting his girlfriend Rose's parents for the first time, especially when he learns that she has not told them that he is black. Their awkward behavior, along with the oddness exhibited by their two African-American servants, puts Chris on alert but even so, he is unprepared for the family's true motivations.\n\nWatch the trailer on Oscar.com here: http://oscar.go.com/video/best-actor-nominees/get-out-trailer\n\nFor more Oscars highlights and can't miss moments visit Oscar.com:\nAcceptance Speeches & Interviews: http://oscar.go.com/video \nRed Carpet Galleries: http://oscar.go.com/red-carpet\nWinners: http://oscar.go.com/winners"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

Check out our expert analysis at Vox: http://bit.ly/2F7xfyW\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nMethod acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ’30s and ’40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski’s system.\n\nToday, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I can totally relate with that, and ASMR is an awesome outlet for those things. However, if you’re interested, above is a link to a website with real, professional & licensed counselors. You can type to them, or call them! It’s actually a really cool service and I use it personally.

Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\n\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

Some people call me the Beyoncé of cakes. I post my drool-worthy, jaw-dropping caking creations every Tuesday at 11am EST!  My novelty cakes come in all shapes and sizes - giant versions of foods, gross stuff like brains, movie characters and some of my favourite things! Basically I love to build stuff out of cake, buttercream, fondant, candy, cookies and anything sweet!\n\nTo make my Chinese Fried Rice Takeout Cake, I stacked and filled my fave Ultimate Chocolate Cake layers with Italian Meringue Buttercream, covered it all in White fondant and decorated the sides with hand-painted characters that spell ‘CAKE’ in Mandarin & Cantonese. Then, I filled the box with trail mix “fried rice” and added some gumpaste chopsticks & fortune cookies on the side for dessert! Talk about a TALL order!\n\nGot an idea for a cake?
